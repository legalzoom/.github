# Support

If you are looking for support, here are a few options:

- High level guidance can be found within our [organization's overview](https://github.com/legalzoom)
- Individual repos make extensive use of their README and Discussions. **Please** update the docs if necessary!
- If you're seeing this, and you'd like to customize it (to include failure modes, runbooks, self-service links, etc), add a [SUPPORT.md](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-support-resources-to-your-project) file accordingly.
